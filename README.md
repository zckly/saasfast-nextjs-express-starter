# Requirements

This application requires a MLab MongoDB environment. It's free and easy to create one! 

1. Go to www.mlab.com
2. Create an account
3. Create a sandbox (free) database
4. Click the database you created and go to the `Users` panel
5. Create a new user for the DB. Don't check the `Make Read-Only` box. Remember the username and password!
6. Look for the section that shows your DB url. Should look something like this: `mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds23123.mlab.com:23123/saasfast`
7. Copy and paste your DB url into the index.js file.

You're done!
